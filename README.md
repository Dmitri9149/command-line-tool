The command line project from here: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html]

"...version of the classic command line tool grep (globally search a regular expression and print). In the simplest use case, grep searches a specified file for a specified string. To do so, grep takes as its arguments a filename and a string. Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines."
